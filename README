Simply copy all commands that you need from robotic_symbols.tex to your LaTeX file or download the file to the folder of your LaTeX project and insert it with
$ \input{robotic_symbols.tex}
Then use the commands in your latex file. Example 
$ \ddq $

extending standardizing and forking:
-----------------------------------

I couldn't find anything like this, so I started migrating all symbols I'm using in my thesis to this tex file. I hope, to not only save time long term but also to foster standardization of annotations in robotics. 
I'm well aware, that the number of acceptable characters is limited and hence there will probably never be to much of a standard. So happy forking! Still its worth trying to push it as much possible. I appreciate every second where I DONT have to think about good annotation.

Some references for annotations that I personally think are fairly standard for the most common variables but also practical and well readable:
